June 21, 2022

by Capri Chang

## Introduction

This game is a two player game.
One player starts on the left, one player starts on the right.
The right player has a gun and a knife.
The left player has a gun and a shield.
If the right player destroys the tower then the right player wins.
If the left player gets the key then he wins.


## Demo

The left player moves with w,a,s,d.
the left bullet shoots with the space key.
The line in the center blocks the players from moving past
After 10 seconds the line dissappears and the damage will double.
The key appears and dissapears

The right player moves with the arrows.
right click uses a knife, and the left click shoots a bullet

The tower has a shield if the left player presses q.


## Discussion

The most challenging part was designing the left player movement.
To allow him to shoot in all direction using only keys and no mouse.

It was challenging to have 2 different modes of the game, before 10 seconds and after 10 seconds the behaviour is different.


If I had more time, I would add some coin to upgrade the damage.
